# NMIXX – KNOW ABOUT ME

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Gonna do it, 'cause I want it
Gonna move, 'cause I want it
Gonna love, 'cause I want it
Gonna run, 'cause I want it
Kill the doubt, I don't want it
Kill the fear, I don't want it
Kill the rule, I don't want it
Know about me
I wanna drop my rhythm
on your fear
들켜도 좋아 everything you feel
본 적 없을테지 like that
무모해도 like that, love
예상을 깨고 흘려보는 틈
제대로 건든 호기심의 끈
까딱인 고갯짓에 쉽게
다른 너를 이끌어내, oh
Would you dive with me
Dive with me, dive?
놓치지 않게
Eyes on me
Eyes on me, now
Let me show you that
Show you that
mm mm
Know about me
(That's that)
Show you that
Show you that
mm mm
Know about me
Won't let you down down
손을 잡아
날 믿고 다음 다음 step을 밟아
Let me show you that
Show you that
mm mm
Know about me
(That's that)
Show you that
Show you that
mm mm
Know about me
Won't let you down down
손을 잡아
네 눈빛 닿아 닿아 뛰는 my heart
So what happened?
두 발이 붕 뜨게 만드는 blush
Give you my heart and affection
난 널 이끄는 pilot
We're gonna fly to the sky
중력을 타고 sway
Ride or die,
let me take you there
Would you dive with me
Dive with me, dive?
재촉해도 돼
Eyes on me
Eyes on me, now
(oh, run)
Let me show you that
Show you that
mm mm
Know about me
(That's that)
Show you that
Show you that
mm mm
Know about me
Won't let you down down
손을 잡아
날 믿고 다음 다음 step을 밟아
Let me show you that
Show you that
mm mm
Know about me
(That's that)
Show you that
Show you that
mm mm
Know about me
Won't let you down down
손을 잡아
네 눈빛 닿아 닿아 뛰는 my heart
Gonna do it, 'cause I want it
Gonna move, 'cause I want it
Gonna love, 'cause I want it
Gonna run, 'cause I want it
Kill the doubt, I don't want it
Kill the fear, I don't want it
Kill the rule, I don't want it
Kill the end, I don't
Let me show you that
Show you that
mm mm
Know about me
(That's that)
Show you that
Show you that
mm mm
Know about me
너와 내 time mm mm 멈추지 마
I have no doubt doubt 이젠 알아
Let me show you that
Show you that
mm mm
Know about me
(That's that)
Show you that
Show you that
mm mm
Know about me
너와 내 time mm mm 멈추지 마
우리가 닿을 다음으로 dive now
