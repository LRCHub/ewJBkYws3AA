Caedmon's Call
Just Don't Want Coffee
Forget What You Know
My friend why do you whip yourself
With the leather of your life
Why do your memories build like
Poison in your mind

You're re-running the mistakes (of your mind)
In the theater of your mind
Hoping that there'll be
A happily ever after this time

Let go
Let go
Let go
And forget what you know

You fear you've walked too far
In the hemlock forest and you are lost
But what error could you invent
With more power than the cross

Let go
Your sin is not an axe
Let go
That can fell the sacred tree
Let go
Your regret is not a net
Let go
That can dredge the forgetting sea

A wise man once told me
When I was dying just the same
The past can be like sidewalk chalk
If you will dance and pray for rain
